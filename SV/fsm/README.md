These files are used for a sample FSM design. The files can be
simulated with any Verilog simulator, however, are designed to work with
Siemens/MGC ModelSim.  To simulate, type the following at a terminal or
in the command prompt:

    vsim -do fsm.do

The DO file will compile all Verilog files and its associated
testbench.  The files can be modified to run with any Verilog file.
