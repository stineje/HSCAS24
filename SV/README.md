This file has sample SystemVerilog files that can help you learn how to simulate designs.  This subdirectory has the examples from the DDCA book; however, no ModelSim files are given within this subdirectory.  All example designs have testbenches and DO files in their directories.  These files are not perfect but can be used to clone to help a user quickly get their simulation going.  The following directories are included:

<ol>
  <li>silly: simple Silly example found in DDCA</li>
  <li>fulladder: simple fulladder example somewhat found in DDCA that documents how to read in testvectors.</li>
  <li>hw1: Homework 1 solutions.</li>
  <li>fsm_example: simple Mealy FSM design similar to what is found in DDCA.</li>
  <li>pipe_riscv: design found in DDCA for pipelined RISC-V but also has testbench set up for ModelSim as well as feature to see instructions in waveform.</li>
  <li>sample: sample design that showcases how to test vectors in the testbench and output the results to a file.</li>
  <li>comparator_tree: example of a modular design but also creating a VCD file that can be used for examination of data or for power analysis.</li>
  <li>comparator_tree_genvar: example of a modular design but uses a generate statement.</li>  
</ol>
