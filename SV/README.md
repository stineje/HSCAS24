This file has sample SystemVerilog files that can help you learn how to simulate designs.  All designs have testbenches and DO files in their directories.  The following directories are included:

<ol>
  <li>silly: simple Silly example found in DDCA</li>
  <li>fulladder: simple fulladder example somewhat found in DDCA that documents how to read in testvectors.</li>
  <li>fsm_example: simple Mealy FSM design similar to what is found in DDCA.</li>
  <li>pipe_riscv: design found in DDCA for pipelined RISC-V but also has testbench set up for ModelSim as well as feature to see instructions in waveform.</li>
  <li>sample: sample design that showcases how to test vectors in the testbench and output the results to a file.</li>
</ol>
